# Dingo: Deep inference for gravitational-wave observations

This code is based on the inference framework described in https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.12594.

# Developing dingo

To install dingo, along with the tools for development and testing, do the following:

Create and activate a virtual environment. By convention, the environment is called `venv` and is located in the `dingo-devel` directory. Some unit tests depend on this convention.

```bash
$ python3 -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
```

In this virtual environment, install dingo.

```bash
$ pip install wheel
$ python setup.py bdist_wheel
$ pip install -e ."[dev]"
```
