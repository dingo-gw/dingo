    "# Neural network architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "Dingo is based on a method called [Neural posterior estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.06376), see [here](sbi.md) for an introduction. A central object is the conditional neural density estimator, a deep neural network trained to represent the Bayesian posterior. This section describes the neural network architecture developed in {cite:p}`Dax:2021tsq`, and subsequently used in {cite:p}`Dax:2021myb`, {cite:p}`Dax:2022pxd` and {cite:p}`Wildberger:2022agw`. Note that Dingo can easily be extended to different architectures.\n",

    "## Neural spline flow with SVD compression\n",
    "The architecture consists of two compenents, the embedding network which compresses the high-dimensionl data to a lower dimensional feature vector, and the conditional normalizing flow which estimates the Bayesian posterior based on this feature vector. Both components are trained jointly and end-to-end with the objective descriped [here](sbi.md). The network can be build with"

The first layer of this network is initialized with an [SVD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_value_decomposition) matrix from a reduced basis built with non-noisy waveforms. This projection filters out the noise that is orthogonal to the signal manifold, and significantly simplifies the task for the neural network.\n",
