.. dingo documentation master file, created by
   sphinx-quickstart on Thu Jan 13 14:37:54 2022.
   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive. If you want to build the docs do 
   `sphinx-build -b html docs/source/ docs/build/` from the dingo-devel directory
   If this is causing and issue try `python3 -m sphinx.cmd.build -b html docs/source docs/build`
   to make sure you are using the correct python module. If you want to generate API-docs ie all of those 
   dingo.core.nn.rst files just run `sphinx-apidoc -o dingo-devel/docs/source dingo-devel/dingo`
