    "\n",
    "A sample from a `WaveformDataset` consists of labeled waveform polarizations $(\\theta_{\\text{intrinsic}}, (h_+,h_\\times))$, represented as a nested dictionary. This must be transformed into noisy detector data $d_I$ (with additional noise context data) in a form suitable for input to a neural network. Dingo accomplishes this by applying a sequence of [**transforms**](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/transforms_tutorial.html) to the sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "A transform is simply a class with a `__call__()` method, which takes a sample as input and returns a transformed sample. A sequence of transforms can be then be [composed](https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/generated/torchvision.transforms.Compose.html#torchvision.transforms.Compose) to build a more complex transform in a modular way. Dingo's training transform sequence is stored as `WaveformDataset.transform`, and is applied automatically when elements are accessed through indexing.\n",

Extrinsic parameters include sky position (right ascension, declination), polarization, time of coalescense, and luminosity distance (the latter two of which are also considered intrinsic parameters).\n",
